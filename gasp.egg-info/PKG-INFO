Description: # Graphics API for Students of Python (GASP)
        
        The goal of GASP is to provide an [immediate
        mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_mode_(computer_graphics)) library
        for beginning Python programmers that supports both proceedural and
        object-oriented programming paradigms.
        
        GASP allows first year programmers to develop 1980s style arcade games.
