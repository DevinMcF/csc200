# Graphics API for Students of Python (GASP)

The goal of GASP is to provide an [immediate
mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_mode_(computer_graphics)) library
for beginning Python programmers that supports both proceedural and
object-oriented programming paradigms.

GASP allows first year programmers to develop 1980s style arcade games.
